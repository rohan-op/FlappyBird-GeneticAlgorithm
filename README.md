# Flappy Bird with Pygame and NEAT

This project is a recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game using Pygame. Additionally, it incorporates the NEAT library to train a model using a genetic algorithm to play the game.

## Overview

The Flappy Bird game is a popular side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird, attempting to navigate it through a series of pipes without colliding with them. In this project, the game mechanics and visual elements of Flappy Bird are implemented using Pygame, a Python library for game development.

The NEAT library is utilized to train a neural network model to play the game autonomously. NEAT is a powerful tool for evolving neural networks through genetic algorithms, allowing the model to improve its performance over time by learning from its mistakes.

## Features

- **Flappy Bird Gameplay**: Experience the classic Flappy Bird gameplay with intuitive controls and visually appealing graphics.
- **NEAT Integration**: The NEAT library is used to train a neural network model to play the game autonomously, employing a genetic algorithm to optimize performance.
- **Customization**: Adjust parameters such as population size, mutation rates, and network structure to fine-tune the learning process and improve the model's performance.

## Modes
**Player Mode**: Control the bird using keyboard input to navigate through the pipes and achieve the highest score possible.
**Autonomous Mode**: Observe as the NEAT-trained model autonomously plays the game, improving its performance over time through genetic algorithms.
